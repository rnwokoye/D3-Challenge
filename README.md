# D3-Challenge
Data Journalism and D3

Background
Welcome to the newsroom! This project aims to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand our findings.
We will run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. Our first story idea is from sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
The data set included with this project is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
